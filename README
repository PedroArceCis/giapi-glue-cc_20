This is the GIAPI C++ Language glue library.

The GIAPI C++ Language glue API  is one of the Language binding options used by 
instrument code to integrate with Gemini.  The C++ API is implemented as a 
shared library in C++. The API sits between the instrument code and the 
Gemini Master Process (GMP).

The GIAPI C++ API library is included with any process that the builder creates 
that must communicate with Gemini. Which processes in the instrument must link 
with and use the C++ API is an instrument design decision. 

The communication protocol between the C++ API and the GMP is encapsulated 
within the GIAPI implementation.

Details about the usage of the API can be found in the Gemini Observatory 
ICD50 - GIAPI C++ Language Glue API

The GIAPI C++ API was compiled with GCC version 4.1 on RedHat Enterprise 
Linux 5 Desktop. The following are tools used to build the GIAPI C++ API: 
*  g++ (GCC) 4.1.1 20070105 (Red Hat 4.1.1-52)  
* GNU Make 3.81 
* GNU ld version 2.17.50.0.6-2.el5 20061020 
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 Desktop, Linux kernel 2.6.18-53.1.6.el5, 32-bit 

The headers to access the GIAPI C++ interface are in the headers directory. The
library shared object is in the lib directory of the binary distribution. 

At this point in the development of GIAPI, the external libraries required
to use the library are

* Apache Active MQ CMS (C++ Messagin system) version 2.2 (from http://activemq.apache.org/cms)
* Apache Log4cxx.(from svn at http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/logging/log4cxx/trunk)

Unfortunately, I could not get a 64-bit machine on time to provide a compiled 
version of the GIAPI that will run directly on our target platform, so the only solution
at this time is to compile the code from the source. Please see the README_INSTALL document
for instructions.    

Good luck,
