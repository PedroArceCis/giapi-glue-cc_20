This is the GIAPI C++ Language glue library.

The GIAPI C++ Language glue API  is one of the Language binding options used by 
instrument code to integrate with Gemini.  The C++ API is implemented as a 
shared library in C++. The API sits between the instrument code and the 
Gemini Master Process (GMP).

The GIAPI C++ API library is included with any process that the builder creates 
that must communicate with Gemini. Which processes in the instrument must link 
with and use the C++ API is an instrument design decision. 

The communication protocol between the C++ API and the GMP is encapsulated 
within the GIAPI implementation.

Details about the usage of the API can be found in the Gemini Observatory 
ICD50 - GIAPI C++ Language Glue API

Good luck,
